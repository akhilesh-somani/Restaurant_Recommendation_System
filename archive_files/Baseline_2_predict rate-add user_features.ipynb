The owners and workers were very friendly and accommodating. \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I ordered a chicken pizza and lasagna. The food was delicious and the portions were fairly large for the price. We were both very full and packed a couple of slices to go. We finished our meals with a cappuccino and latte. Overall a great first experience.',\n",
       " 'Tried out this place on my way home from work, every lovely place! The food is very delicious and supper cheap, you get a free drink when you check in here too! The service was amazing, the owner was so nice, we didnt know that the stored was closed and yet he still advised us to stay and enjoy the coffee for another extra hour after operation time. Such a great service! Would highly recommend this restaurant.',\n",

We ordered pasta with prosciutto and rose sauce (personally, the sauce was a bit thick, but the flavor was perfect), tuna salad, lattÃƒÂ©, and a complimentary cappuccino. It was a wonderful meal, with a leisurely atmosphere. The staff are also attentive and kind, taking the effort to chat with their customers and get to know them.',\n",

It was creamy smooth strong but not bitter with  excellent taste. \\n\\nI also enjoyed the breakfast sandwich with fried egg ,prosciutto lettuce and tomato on a croissant. Oh my ...this changes what breakfast looks like for me!!\\nIt was delicious!\\n\\nThe people are very friendly with the typical Italian hospitality. It seems that they really care and that the value of their customers\\n\\nI'm going to order a  Caprese   salad to take to work with me today I can't wait to try it\\n\\n\\nIt's in a slightly out-of-the-way location but well worth the extra few steps or manoeuvres in the car that it would take to get here. Try it try it try it!!!\\n\\n\\nFood is a high priority for me and I would not lead you astray. It is clean fresh and well-made fare!\\nCheck out their cappuccino!!\"]"

       "[\"I went to Momiji at night wanting to find out what this new restaurant is all about. I was greeted instantly by a friendly waiter who took me to my seat. \\n\\nThey have a variety of Japanese food to choose from and the food quality is fairly good. \\n\\n At night, their tables are dimly lit with sports games playing on TV providing a bar environment. It's a great place to go if you want to go watch sports games with a group of friends and talk or a place to meet your date.\\n\\nThe only downside to this restaurant at night is the food tends to be priced slightly higher, but the environment and service provided justifies the price.\",\n",
       " \"I went to this place solely on the recommendations read here on Yelp. \\n\\nMy first impression of the place is that it's tidy and nicely decorated. That earned a star. \\n\\nThe waitress were attentive was quick to provide service. 2nd star.\\n\\n\\nI ordered a sushi and sashimi dinner combo and it came in a tiny boat nicely decorated. 3rd star. \\n\\nWhere it lost points were 2 things:\\n- prices of food aren't ridiculous but they are quite high for some items (ie: sushi and sashimi boat starting at 44.95)\\n\\n- The rice used on sushi and maki were hard. This tells me the rice has been sitting around for a while.\\n\\n- the fish inside the Maki was warm and the sushi and sashimi fishes were colder but still seems like it's been defrosted for a while\\n\\nMy concern immediately became food safety. This was met with the response of major stomach ache right after I finished the complimentary ice cream. \\n\\nDon't think I will be going back.\",\n",
       " \"Homemade family style catering, I was welcome instantly by the owner himself when I walk through that. He handed a menu to me and answered my questions. I ordered a chorizo burrito with salad and rice on the side. While waiting, he offered nachos on the house asked if I wanted drinks. As I was about to pay, he said that it was not necessary until I finished my meal. The food was awesome (although the chorizo could be less salty) and one of the best Mexican food I've tasted so far in Canada. I definitely plan on returning.\",\n",
       " \"Garbage burgers.  This location killed the Hero experience for me.  I came here because I had been to the one at Richmond Hill and I loved the burgers there.  They were juicy in every bite and I couldn't get enough of the fries. \\n\\nAt this location however, the burgers were dry.  I had literally one dab of ketchup in the entire burger! Outrageous!\\n\\nThe fountain machine was cool, where you could mix the flavors but it tasted like sugar water more than anything else. \\n\\nNever coming back to this location again.\",\n",
       " \"Was curious about Portuguese food and decided on this place for summerlicious and read a lot of review before doing so.  My sister got the 7oz Portuguese Steak, delicious.  I ordered the Shrimp Casserole and loved it.  \\n\\nThe reviews were right on the money about the Grouper.  The outer layer was burnt and fish slightly overcooked (slightly disappointed since Portuguese food is big on fish).\\n\\nHowever, service was good and attentive despite the busy environment. \\n\\nWe were asked if we wanted refills for the bread to which we agreed on.  The bread combined with the stacked bottle containing balsamic vinegar and olive oil was one of the many highlights of the the starter to the meal.\\n\\nThe musician played a few classic songs during the meal on his keyboard to which I did not mind.  He had a tiny disco light shooting hearts and start patterns into the ceiling which was a bonus.  It's not a bad place to take your significant other on a date, maybe even dance to a few songs, but I wish he played more.  \\n\\nAside from that, he played the birthday song a few times as there were a few being celebrated.  The atmosphere was lively and everyone joined in to sing and clap for the embarrassed birthday man/woman.\\n\\nFor the price that you pay the amount and quality of food and service cannot be dismissed.  If you avoid the Grouper, this place will give you a run for your money.\",\n",
       " \"Came here today due to the overwhelming positive reviews of this restaurant and wanted to see what the hype was all about.\\n\\nMy meal consisted of\\n\\n1) Sushi Delight Dinner ($12.95)\\n2) Volcano Roll ($11.95)\\n\\nHere's the rating:\\nEnvironment: 5/5\\nService: 5/5\\nFood: 4/5\\nPrice: 5/5\\n\\nIt's a small restaurant, but had lots of comfortable sofa booth seats.  There was the back patio that I did not use due to how hot it was today.  They had the A/C on and it was comfortable (not freezing cold or turned down to a point that you can't feel it).  They had authentic Japanese music playing in the background (most of them ranging between 80s to late 90s along with some more classic old school Japanese music).\\n\\nParking would probably be an issue for the weekday goers, but certainly wasn't an issue for me granted I went on a weekend.  There was space at the back so it wasn't too troublesome to park.\\n\\nService was excellent. Like the others have reported, they asked multiple times how the food was and if I liked the dinner.  Service was also quick (there weren't too many people around).  Contrary to a review written on here, the staff here are not Japanese. If you listen to their conversation, you would identify that it is in fact Korean that they are speaking in. So this is not an authentic Japanese restaurant, but that didn't bother me at all.\\n\\nThe food was alright.  They didn't follow the traditional Japanese restaurant makis and rolls which I think is what makes this restaurant special.  This volcano roll was nowhere near spicy (I could barely taste any spice).  The flame added a really cool effect, which I liked and the ingredients tasted well.  Where it lost points was the quality of the rice. It felt overly sticky to me so everything just mushes in your mouth and it loses some of the taste.  Their Sushi Delight dinner was alright, but slightly underwhelmed by the amount of fish I got, but what can I expect for that price?  Still, this is where I've taken away 1 star for.\\n\\nThis brings me to Price!  The price  I thought was on the cheaper side of things, but the savings achieved were also at the cost of the quality of food.  Normal rolls nowadays cost somewhere between $12 - $17, granted they were bigger in size that the volcano roll I tasted.  The Sushi Delight was mostly rice with a few pieces of sashimi chopped into tiny blocks and served to you wrapped with an abundance of rice.\\n\\nWould I return? \\n\\nPossibly.  It's certainly not a bad place to go, but it won't be a place I'd take someone on a date to or where fanciness is a necessity.\",\n",
       " \"Great environment to play board games. The service is great with friendly staff that provides great recommendations and teaches you how to play the games to get you started.  \\n\\nTheir game selection is fairly large as well. You won't find yourself out of games to play.\",\n",
       " 'The noodles are different than what\\'s out on the market. I would however, prefer noodles that are a bit more chewy, although that\\'s a personal preference. The soup base is amazing and what you get for the price is the bang for the buck. We tried the fully loaded Kyouka ramen and the Veggie Shio Ramen. Both tasted well. We added a dipped ramen and found to be less fond of it than the rest. It probably would\\'ve tasted better if the noodles were chilled. \\n\\nThe service was good. When we identified that the Kyouka ramen was missing the extra toppings as per the \"fully loaded\" edition, the waitress got us a bowl with the missed toppings and apologized. I think the experience could be improved if she had told us she was going to get the missed toppings rather than simply acknowledging it and moving on. We had no idea if she went to get more toppings or if we would be left in the cold.\\n\\nOne draw back of this place is the limited space. The location of the bar tables were too close to tables near by.  There was next to no space to get past other patrons in the restaurant.',\n",
       " 'This is my first time trying Turkish food. A friend took me to this restaurant and I was impressed. The service was great and the place well decorated. The food was also exceptional. Would love to go back for a second round in the future.',\n",
       " \"Very satisfied with their service. It was my first time here and they took the time to explain how the pricing works. We were asked the type of soup base we like and was given a seat within 5 minutes of waiting even when we were told it would take 15 minutes. There's a fair amount of variety for food and to my surprise, they had a lot of vegetables (something absent in most restaurants when eating out).\",\n",
       " \"It is the first time I've had coffee at this place. I tried their regular coffee and loved it instantly. The medium blend was perfect and I was able to drink the coffee black, which I couldn't do for low grade coffee. It's a great place to catch up with friends or go on a date as the location is quiet and the environment well decorated. Their cheese cake is also great! I tried their blueberry cheese cake and the sweetness was just right, not too sweet and the texture is great. I'll definitely return for future gatherings with friends.\",\n",
       " \"I went here based on the reviews on Yelp and it didn't disappoint. The service was wonderful and the most amazing part is that you get to build your own bowl. I went all out building my own salmon poke bowl with brown rice, added seaweed salad (+ $1.5) and Avocado (+$1.5) with Kimchi, carrots, kale, pumpkin seeds, and topping it off with Wasabi mayo. \\n\\nIt was the best thing I've ever tasted. It just goes to show that good tasting food can also be good for your health. They're also giving away cards to collect stamps so you can get 10% off from time to time and one free item when you collect 10 stamps.\\n\\nThis place has won me over. I'm now a fan.\",\n",
       " 'A friendly atmosphere to play some games with friends. It also has a bar for those who like to drink. The games there are fairly cheap to play (from $0.25 to $1 a game. \\n\\nMy favourite game is the shuffle board.',\n",
       " 'Wonderful spaghetti, simple yet clean environment, splendid service, and amazing Cappuccino with latte art. What more can you ask for?\\n\\nThis is one of the favourite places I frequent.']"
